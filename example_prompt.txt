Heavy impasto oil painting, palette knife texture, visible raised paint, expressive brushwork. 
A medium shot of three women walking away from the viewer along a sunny sandy beach. 
They are barefoot, walking towards the turquoise ocean horizon. 
The wet sand reflects their figures in blocky paint strokes. 
The sky is a vibrant azure blue filled with chunky, textured white cumulus clouds.
